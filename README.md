## Introduction

MediQuiz meets the growing demand for continuous, easily digestible learning in the medical field. Our platform reshapes traditional, often outdated, medical education by creating a dynamic, responsive system that keeps pace with the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. Through micro-credentials, we motivate medical professionals to participate in regular, targeted learning that can be quickly integrated into their practice.

Our system aims to reduce medical errors—a major cause of death and poor health outcomes—by ensuring that healthcare professionals maintain up-to-date skills and knowledge in line with the latest evidence-based practices and technologies. MediQuiz makes ongoing professional development more accessible, engaging, and closely aligned with the demands of everyday medical practice.
